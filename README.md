Baloks Games
=========================

creating a classic game like Tetris, but with slightly different shapes to avoid trademark licensing from Tetris brand. This game is created solely for practice purposes and will not be commercialized with features such as ads and in-app purchases. Additionally, this game is designed to evoke memories of my childhood playing this classic game on the Game Boy, hence I've designed the UI with a Game Boy theme, although it may not be identical.

You can freely download this game on the Play Store using the following [link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dailyhopeless.baloks):

Here is the flowchart for the UI layout of the game I created.
